# Tweet-Analyzer

The main objective of the project is prediction of userâ€™s tweets so, the project is based on a multi label text classification model for prediction. In this project, I will classify tweets for ten categories which are art, game, movie, music, politic, science, sport, technology, travel, and tv. I scraped data for these categories and trained a machine learning model for these categories. Also, the project has many phases to getting prediction.
